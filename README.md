The ‘Human Sentiment Recognition’ (HSR) model has shown higher rate of accuracy and it can be used in daily life. The model is very promising in the field of psychology and generates reviews based on facial emotion. In HSR we have used deep learning, CNN which consists of collecting data, data processing, and feature extraction and finally generating the results based on facial sentiments. The model successfully analysed the face and generated result (happy, sad, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, and neutral). HSR has the potential to advance many applications, from personalization of experiences to mental health assessments and generating honest reviews. By solving challenges and ethical issues, we can use the power of HSR to improve people and society as a whole. We are limited to only a few emotions and this research will lead and encourage the upcoming generation to dig deep into this topic and make future development.
